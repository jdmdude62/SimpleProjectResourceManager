| Week 3-4 | Phase 3 | Open Items module |
| Week 5-6 | Phase 4 | Multi-user infrastructure |

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Network Database Performance**
   - Mitigation: Consider PostgreSQL for true multi-user support
   - Alternative: Implement server-based API

2. **LDAP Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple authentication
   - Provide manual user management fallback

3. **SharePoint API Limitations**
   - Mitigation: Use Microsoft Graph API
   - Implement incremental sync

### Business Risks
1. **User Adoption**
   - Mitigation: Implement phases based on user feedback
   - Provide training documentation

2. **Data Migration**
   - Mitigation: Maintain backwards compatibility
   - Provide migration tools

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1**: Project edit accessible, addresses visible in timeline
- **Phase 2**: Resources can be filtered by skills, multi-select works
- **Phase 3**: Open items tracking operational
- **Phase 4**: Multiple users can access simultaneously
- **Phase 5**: PDF export generates correctly

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1 quick wins
2. Gather user feedback after each phase
3. Adjust priorities based on business needs
4. Document features as implemented

## Notes

- All database changes will include migration scripts
- Each phase includes unit tests
- UI changes will maintain current design language

## Future Enhancement: AI Integration

After completing the core implementation phases, the next major enhancement will be adding AI capabilities to provide intelligent project management assistance. This will address the competitive gap with tools like OpenProject (which lacks AI) while maintaining our position between MS Project's complexity and MS Planner's simplicity.

**See: [AI_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](AI_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)** for comprehensive AI feature planning including:
- Natural Language Processing for task creation
- Predictive analytics for delay prevention
- Resource optimization and conflict detection
- Field service specific features (weather, equipment tracking)
- Computer vision for progress monitoring
- Continuous learning system

The AI implementation is designed to be added incrementally after the core system is stable, with Phase 1 AI features beginning approximately 3 months after core completion.
- Performance benchmarks before/after each phase
