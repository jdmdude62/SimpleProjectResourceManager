# SharePoint Integration Plan for Simple Project Resource Manager
*Created: August 29, 2025*

## Executive Summary
Design and implement SharePoint integration to provide mobile-accessible schedule viewing for field technicians and resources, leveraging existing SharePoint admin capabilities.

## Primary Goal
Enable field technicians to view their schedules via SharePoint mobile app without requiring VPN or desktop access to the JavaFX application.

## Integration Architecture Options

### Option 1: SharePoint Lists with Power Automate (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Native SharePoint mobile support
- No additional licensing required
- Works with SharePoint app on iOS/Android
- Easy to maintain as SharePoint admin
- Built-in security and permissions

**Cons:**
- One-way sync initially
- Limited UI customization

**Implementation:**
1. Create SharePoint Lists for Projects, Resources, and Assignments
2. Java app pushes updates via SharePoint REST API
3. Power Automate handles data transformation if needed
4. SharePoint mobile app provides view access

### Option 2: SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Custom Web Parts
**Pros:**
- Fully customizable UI
- Interactive features possible
- Can embed in Teams

**Cons:**
- Requires TypeScript/React development
- More complex deployment
- Maintenance overhead

### Option 3: Power Apps Integration
**Pros:**
- Rich mobile experience
- Two-way data sync possible
- Custom forms and workflows

**Cons:**
- Additional Power Apps licensing may be required
- Learning curve for Power Apps development

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Required
```
GET https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/sites/{site}/_api/web/lists
POST https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/sites/{site}/_api/web/lists('{list-id}')/items
PATCH https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/sites/{site}/_api/web/lists('{list-id}')/items({item-id})
DELETE https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/sites/{site}/_api/web/lists('{list-id}')/items({item-id})
```

### Java Dependencies
```xml
<!-- Microsoft Graph SDK -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.graph</groupId>
    <artifactId>microsoft-graph</artifactId>
    <version>5.74.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Azure Identity for Authentication -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-identity</artifactId>
    <version>1.11.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- JSON Processing -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.15.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### Sync Strategy
1. **Initial Load:** Full sync of all active projects and resources
2. **Incremental Updates:** Push changes as they occur in Java app
3. **Scheduled Sync:** Nightly full reconciliation
4. **Conflict Resolution:** Java app as source of truth

### Security Considerations
- Use app-only permissions (no user delegation)
- Encrypt credentials at rest
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Audit log all sync operations
- Use item-level permissions for sensitive projects

## Mobile User Experience

### Primary Views

#### 1. My Schedule (Default)
- List of assigned projects for current user
- Grouped by date (Today, This Week, Next Week)
- Color coding for project status
- Quick access to project details

#### 2. Calendar View
- Monthly calendar with assignment blocks
- Day view with hourly breakdown
- Travel days highlighted
- PTO/unavailable days marked

#### 3. Project Details
- Project information card
- Team members list
- Location with map link
- Documents and resources
- Open items count

#### 4. Resource Directory
- Searchable list of all resources
- Contact information
- Current assignments
- Availability status

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed data in SharePoint
- Use CDN for static resources
- Implement pagination for large lists
- Lazy load detailed information

### Sync Optimization
- Batch API calls (up to 100 items per request)
- Use delta queries for change tracking
- Compress data transfers
- Queue updates during peak hours

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Sync latency < 5 minutes
