Software Enhancements/Improvements:

Bug: The Project Edit Dialog is missing from selection in menu or speed button in toolbar. That included the client information.

Story: As a project managar and scheduler I want to see the address of the project's client in the timeline bar, at the bottom of the bar (3 total lines in the bar vs the current 2)


Story: As a Project Manager / Scheduler, I want to assign resources based on the roles they are best at
Role identification (CRUD):
 - Identify Certifications
 - Identify Skills

 
 Resources:
 - assign Certifacations and skills (many to one)
 - using the roles and skills I would like to select 
  - It would nice to set a scoring system (1-5)  5 being the most accomplished or highest competency
  

Story: As a scheduler I need to assign many resources to a project. I would like to select multiples from a list of resources and see whether or not they are in conflict with the project AS i am selecting.

Story: As a project manager I need an "Open Items" per Project (Please research industry best practices).
   - Very similar to the Task List view
      - Items replace tasks
	  - Items are more granular
	  - Items may/or may not connect to a task
	  - Will need grid view / Kan Bahn / 
	  - Apply Est Start Date / Est End Date, Start Date / End Date and progress of each
		- indicators when something hasn't been done, ontime, late, at risk (industry standard language)
		
Need to make this a multi-user application with the database on a network drive:
   - Four user groups:
      - Executive Admin: Access to all. Not sure what would be applied at this time, will probably be finance related.
	  - Administrators: Access to all to date. All Project Managers
	  - Scheduler: Able to CRUD assignments of resources but not create the project
	  - Viewer: View of selected areas of the project. Mostly the ability to see their own schedules
	      - This is the part we really want pushed to Sharepoint
	      - Resources will be Viewers
	- Not yet, but need to make allocation to switch to LDAP groups that are yet to be named.
	   - Probably need a settings page for LDAP connection information:
	      - This could be an Executive Admin thing
		  
Story as a Project Manager or Scheduler, I want to see Resource unavailability of all resources in a grid and timeline kind of view. I want to be able to see conflicts easily

Story: I like the main screen that opens in the beginning, I want a way to print this out, based on a date range, to a wide format pdf for offline viewing.
